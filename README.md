# GeoPix

GeoPix is a free and open source real-time lighting control and previz software. It's built in TouchDesigner, with a workflow and UI/UX inspired by 3d animation software.

The primary goal in developing GeoPix was to unify the process of working with different types of lights, such as led strips, dmx lights, and video surfaces, and more while streamlining the process of mapping real-time video and generative content onto complex arrays of pixels and lights.

Lastly, GeoPix also aims to bridge the gap between lighting control, and lighting pre-visualization - two tasks that generally require multiple, potentially expensive software & hardware elements.
